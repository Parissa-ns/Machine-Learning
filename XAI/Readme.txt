1) We Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing tasks using Pandas, including CSV data reading, column dropping, and one-hot encoding for 
categorical variables.
2) We Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's structure, correlations, and distributions, 
utilizing visualization techniques such as correlation matrix heatmaps and summary statistics.

3) Implemented outlier detection techniques and data-driven decisions to identify and handle outliers, ensuring data quality and 
integrity for subsequent analysis.

4) Created informative visualizations, including scatter plots with colored data points, to visualize relationships between variables 
and enhance understanding of the dataset.

5) Developed a classification algorithm using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict lower back pain classification based on relevant 
features, achieving an accuracy of 85%.

6) Utilized the sklearn library for SVM model training, testing, and evaluation, demonstrating proficiency in machine learning model
development.

7) Employed the SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) library to explain the SVM model's predictions and interpret the impact of different
features on the model's output.

8) Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming language and familiarity with key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn,
scikit-learn, and SHAP for data analysis, visualization, modeling, and interpretation.

9) Applied analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking to tackle challenges related to data analysis, 
model development, and interpretation, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the analysis.

10) Communicated findings, methodologies, and results effectively to stakeholders through clear and concise documentation, and collaborated
with team members to exchange ideas and optimize the workflow, contributing to the project's success.
