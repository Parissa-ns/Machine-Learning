I Employed linear regression and LASSO regression techniques to scrutinize features associated with the response to 
Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy(NAC).
Then, Identified a sparse set of significant features through linear regression analysis, yet the approach demonstrated limitations in
feature selection.
We Leveraged LASSO regression, a regularization method, to address feature selection challenges. 
* This method effectively identified 8 crucial features, aligning closely with findings obtained from SHAP values analysis.
We utilized cross-validation to optimize the selection of the LASSO regularization parameter, ensuring robust feature selection
and enhancing model accuracy.
